# Advent of Code JavaScript solutions

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2020. 
This is my first year participating and I figured it would be fun to try it with JavaScript, which I don't yet have much experience with. 

To get started:

`npm install`

To run the solutions:

`node index.js 2020 {day}`

for example:

`node index.js 2020 1`
